Hi! I'm a software engineer at [Oxbotica](https://www.oxbotica.com/) and I mainly work on Localisation and Mapping. Before joining the company, I studied BEng Mechatronics and Robotics Engineer at University of Birmingham and worked as an undergraduate research associate at [Extreme Robotics Laboratory](https://www.linkedin.com/company/extreme-robotics-lab/).

I'm mainly interested in the three areas: Robotics, Math and Computer Science. I like to find practical, real-world problems in robotics field, and try to formulate them using math. Then, I like to find a way to solve those problem efficiently and effectively using skills in computer science.

I mainly use this site to record some of my learning notes in robotics, math and computer science. I will also add some example code I used for understanding some of the materials.
