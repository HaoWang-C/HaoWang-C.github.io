Hi! I'm a software engineer at [Oxbotica](https://www.oxbotica.com/) and I mainly work on Localisation and Mapping. Before joining the company, I studied BEng Mechatronics and Robotics Engineer at University of Birmingham and worked as an undergraduate research associate at [Extreme Robotics Laboratory](https://www.linkedin.com/company/extreme-robotics-lab/).

I'm mainly interested in three areas: Robotics, Math and Computer Science. I enjoy finding practical, real-world problems in robotics field, formulating and solving them using math and writing code to implement the solution efficiently.

I'm using this site to record some of my learning notes and example code I used for understanding the materials.
