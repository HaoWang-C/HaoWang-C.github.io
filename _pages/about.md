Hi! I'm a software engineer at [Oxbotica](https://www.oxbotica.com/) and I mainly work on Localisation and Mapping. Before joining the company, I studied BEng Mechatronics and Robotics Engineer at University of Birmingham and worked as an undergraduate research associate at [Extreme Robotics Laboratory](https://www.linkedin.com/company/extreme-robotics-lab/).

I'm mainly interested in the three areas: Robotics, Math and Computer Science. I like finding practical, real-world problems in robotics field, and trying to formulate and solve them using math. I also enjoy finding a way to compute the solution efficiently and effectively using skills in computer science.

I'm using this site to record some of my learning notes and links to some of the example code I used for understanding the materials.
